# Security Verification Report

## Scope
- `contracts/AGIJobManager.sol`
- Utility libraries used by AGIJobManager
- ENS integration contracts and assembly call compatibility assumptions

## Tooling Versions
- Foundry: `forge 1.5.1-stable (b0a9dd9ced)`
- Solidity compiler: `0.8.19` (from `foundry.toml`)
- Slither: `0.10.4`
- Echidna: not included (Foundry handler invariants already cover the multi-step state machine with deterministic CI runtime)

## Reproduction Commands
```bash
npm ci

# Foundry checks
forge fmt --check
FOUNDRY_PROFILE=ci forge build
FOUNDRY_PROFILE=ci forge test --no-match-path "forge-test/invariant/*.t.sol"
FOUNDRY_PROFILE=ci forge test --match-path "forge-test/invariant/*.t.sol"

# Static analysis
pip install slither-analyzer==0.10.4
npm run slither
```

## Added Verification Coverage

### Unit / Regression (Foundry)
- ENS authorization path regression:
  - deterministic NameWrapper ownership path succeeds for valid labels
  - invalid ENS label formatting is rejected deterministically.
- ENS selector and calldata compatibility checks assert:
  - `handleHook(uint8,uint256)` selector = `0x1f76f7a2`, calldata length `0x44`
  - `jobEnsURI(uint256)` selector = `0x751809b4`, calldata length `0x24`
  - low-level calls return ABI-valid string data.
- Strict transfer semantics:
  - Fee-on-transfer token is rejected in exact transfer flows.
- Integration resilience:
  - Reverting ENS hook target does not brick settlement.
  - Malformed ENS URI ABI does not break finalization.
- Reentrancy regression:
  - ERC721 receiver callback reentry into `finalizeJob` cannot double-settle.

### Fuzzing (Foundry)
- Boundary fuzz for:
  - payout and duration validity envelope in `createJob`
  - job spec/details/completion URI caps
  - dispute-bond floor/ceiling behavior (`[1 AGI, 200 AGI]`)
  - validator approvals/disapprovals accounting consistency at threshold/tie edges
  - hard validator cap enforcement (`MAX_VALIDATORS_PER_JOB = 50`)

### Invariants (Handler-based)
Handler actions include:
- create/apply/request completion/vote/finalize/dispute/resolve stale/expire/cancel/delist
- owner pause toggles and settlement pause toggles
- owner `withdrawAGI` and `rescueERC20` under guarded preconditions

Invariants enforced:
1. **Solvency:** contract AGI balance is always >= all locked totals.
2. **Withdraw safety:** `withdrawableAGI()` remains callable without reverting during valid operation.
3. **Locked accounting consistency:** aggregate locked totals exactly equal recomputed sums over live jobs.
4. **Vote accounting sanity:** `validators.length == approvals + disapprovals` per job.
5. **Terminal sanity:** mutually exclusive invalid flag combinations are disallowed.
6. **Agent concurrency cap:** `activeJobsByAgent <= maxActiveJobsPerAgent` for tracked actors.
7. **Deleted-job accounting sanity:** deleted jobs must carry zero residual bond/validator accounting fields.

## CI Integration
- Added `.github/workflows/security-verification.yml` for PR/push:
  - `forge fmt --check`
  - `forge build`
  - forge unit/fuzz tests
  - forge invariant suite
  - Slither execution with fail-on medium/high

## Slither Findings Triage
- **Accepted by design:** privileged owner/admin control surfaces (`onlyOwner`) per business-operated trust model.
- **False positives / low-noise filtered:** currently controlled via repository `slither.config.json` path filters and detector exclusions for non-actionable categories.
- **Fixed issues:** no new production-contract patches were required by this pass; focus stayed on verification harnesses and regression coverage.

## Residual Risks / Assumptions
- Owner/operator privilege remains central by design.
- Liveness and emergency controls (pause/settlement pause) are operational controls, not decentralized guarantees.
- ENS integration remains optional/best-effort and intentionally non-blocking for escrow lifecycle safety.
