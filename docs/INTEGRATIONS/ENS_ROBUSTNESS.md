# ENS Robustness, Failure Modes, and Operations

> **Intended operations model: AI agents exclusively.** Human operators provide governance and oversight; routine protocol participation is for autonomous AI agents.


This playbook defines how ENS-linked behavior degrades, how failures surface on-chain, and which operator levers remain safe.

> **Operator note**
> Authorization is fail-closed (`NotAuthorized`) while hook/metadata integrations are best-effort by design. See [`contracts/AGIJobManager.sol`](../../contracts/AGIJobManager.sol) and [`contracts/utils/ENSOwnership.sol`](../../contracts/utils/ENSOwnership.sol).

## Failure modes and remediations

| Failure mode | Symptoms | On-chain behavior | UI / operator impact | Safe remediation | Prevention |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ENS registry misconfigured | valid ENS users fail authorization | resolver path returns false; eventual `NotAuthorized` | admissions friction | if unlocked + escrow empty: `updateEnsRegistry`; otherwise use Merkle/allowlist path | peer-reviewed chain-specific address book |
| NameWrapper misconfigured/unavailable | wrapped names not recognized | wrapper checks return false; fallback resolver may still pass | partial authorization failures | `updateNameWrapper` when allowed; temporarily rely on resolver + Merkle | staged rollout tests on wrapper + resolver vectors |
| Wrong root node(s) | legitimate labels rejected or wrong namespace accepted | deterministic subnode mismatch | policy drift risk | rotate roots via `updateRootNodes` (unlocked + empty escrow) | dual-control root constant review |
| Label input malformed | user submits invalid string label | `EnsLabelUtils.requireValidLabel` path fails and action reverts | user support load | enforce label validation in client and ops runbooks | strict UI input constraints |
| ENS ownership changed unexpectedly | prior participant loses/changes eligibility | future gating follows new ownership state | onboarding surprises | communicate policy; override with Merkle/allowlist if needed | pre-action ownership checks in operator tooling |
| Hook target (`ensJobPages`) reverts | hook-related events show failure | `_callEnsJobPagesHook` emits `EnsHookAttempted` and continues | job page state may lag | fix or unset `ensJobPages`; keep settlement live | continuous hook smoke tests |
| `jobEnsURI` malformed/reverting | expected ENS token URI absent | `_mintJobNFT` keeps base URI when ENS URI call fails/invalid | metadata discrepancy | disable ENS URI mode via `setUseEnsJobTokenURI(false)` | enable only after hardened integration tests |
| Identity configuration locked too early | cannot rewrite ENS/token/root wiring | guarded setters revert `ConfigLocked` | cannot correct wiring in-place | operate with Merkle/allowlists; plan controlled migration | formal lock checklist with sign-off |
| RPC / indexer outage | monitoring cannot read ENS state reliably | contract logic unchanged | observability gaps | fail closed operationally, switch providers | multi-provider dashboards + alerts |

Reference implementation anchors:
- Fail-closed authorization entrypoints: [`applyForJob`](../../contracts/AGIJobManager.sol#L516-L543), [`validateJob`](../../contracts/AGIJobManager.sol#L594-L618), [`disapproveJob`](../../contracts/AGIJobManager.sol#L620-L644).
- Best-effort ENS hooks and metadata reads: [`_callEnsJobPagesHook`](../../contracts/AGIJobManager.sol#L1282-L1302), [`_mintJobNFT`](../../contracts/AGIJobManager.sol#L1189-L1232), [`ENSJobPages.handleHook`](../../contracts/ens/ENSJobPages.sol#L204-L261).
- Identity lock boundaries: [`lockIdentityConfiguration`](../../contracts/AGIJobManager.sol#L738-L741) freezes identity rewiring functions guarded by [`whenIdentityConfigurable`](../../contracts/AGIJobManager.sol#L558-L561). `updateMerkleRoots` remains separately owner-callable for ongoing allowlist operations.

## Security posture

| Threat vector | Impact | Mitigation in code | Residual risk | Operator responsibilities |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ENS key compromise | attacker may satisfy ENS-based eligibility | multi-path auth (allowlist/Merkle/ENS) + blacklist levers | temporary unauthorized admissions | rotate Merkle roots, blacklist addresses, incident communication |
| Owner misconfiguration | outage or authorization drift | empty-escrow gate + explicit lock semantics | human error remains | staged deployment procedure and peer review |
| External contract anomalies | false negatives/instability | gas-bounded staticcalls, conservative decode, false on malformed reads | availability degradation | maintain emergency non-ENS authorization policy |
| Hook target compromise | corrupted ENS page metadata | best-effort dispatch, non-fatal to settlement | off-chain integrity concerns | disable hook/ENS URI mode and investigate |
| Phishing/social engineering | user wallet compromise | explicit non-goal; no on-chain anti-phishing guarantees | persistent ecosystem risk | user training and signed operator advisories |

> **Non-goals / limitations**
> - ENS ownership is not legal identity, KYC, or reputation truth.
> - ENS integration cannot prevent compromised wallets or social recovery abuse.
> - `lockIdentityConfiguration` is intentionally irreversible.

## Monitoring and observability

### Events to watch

From `AGIJobManager`:
- `EnsRegistryUpdated`, `NameWrapperUpdated`, `RootNodesUpdated`, `MerkleRootsUpdated`
- `IdentityConfigurationLocked`, `EnsJobPagesUpdated`, `EnsHookAttempted`, `NFTIssued`

From optional `ENSJobPages`:
- `ENSHookProcessed`, `ENSHookSkipped`, `ENSHookBestEffortFailure`
- `JobENSPageCreated`, `JobENSPermissionsUpdated`, `JobENSLocked`

Suggested alert semantics:
- Alert **high** when `EnsRegistryUpdated`, `NameWrapperUpdated`, `RootNodesUpdated`, or `IdentityConfigurationLocked` is emitted outside approved change windows.
- Alert **medium** when `EnsHookAttempted` or `ENSHookProcessed` reports repeated failures, because these indicate metadata drift but not escrow breakage.
- Alert **critical** when operational test vectors that previously passed begin reverting with `NotAuthorized` for known-good identities.

### Sanity-check reads

- Identity wiring: `ens()`, `nameWrapper()`, `clubRootNode()`, `agentRootNode()`, `alphaClubRootNode()`, `alphaAgentRootNode()`, `lockIdentityConfig()`.
- Policy fallback: `validatorMerkleRoot()`, `agentMerkleRoot()`, `additionalAgents(address)`, `additionalValidators(address)`.
- Hook mode: `ensJobPages()`, `tokenURI(tokenId)` and expected `NFTIssued` URI.

## Runbooks

### Safe configuration change checklist

1. Confirm change ticket, reviewer approvals, and blast-radius analysis.
2. Verify `lockedEscrow`, `lockedAgentBonds`, `lockedValidatorBonds`, and `lockedDisputeBonds` are zero.
3. Execute one change at a time and inspect emitted events.
4. Run known-good and known-bad authorization vectors.
5. Confirm fallback controls (Merkle + allowlist) still operate.
6. Decide on irreversible lock only after full verification.

### Incident response: ENS compromised root/namespace

1. Freeze intake paths operationally (front-end + operator runbook controls).
2. Blacklist confirmed malicious addresses.
3. Rotate Merkle roots immediately for continuity and blacklist compromised addresses.
4. If unlocked and escrow empty, rotate root nodes and revalidate test vectors.
5. Publish operator advisory and post-incident report.

Immediate containment transaction set (ordered):
1. `pause()` / `pauseAll()` as operational policy requires.
2. `blacklistAgent` / `blacklistValidator` for known compromised addresses.
3. Use `updateMerkleRoots` at any time as needed; reserve root/address rewiring for unlocked + empty-escrow windows.
4. `addAdditionalAgent`/`addAdditionalValidator` (still available post-lock) for continuity.
5. `setUseEnsJobTokenURI(false)` if ENS URI drift is observed.

### If configuration is locked

- **Still mutable:** allowlists, blacklists, pause controls, settlement operations.
- **Frozen:** `updateAGITokenAddress`, `updateEnsRegistry`, `updateNameWrapper`, `setEnsJobPages`, `updateRootNodes`.
- **Recovery:** continue with remaining policy levers or execute a controlled contract migration.
