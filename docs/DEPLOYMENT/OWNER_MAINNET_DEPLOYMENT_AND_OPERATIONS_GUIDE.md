# Owner Mainnet Deployment & Operations Guide

## 0) Start here first (non-technical owner)

If you are pressed for time, follow this safe order:
1. Deploy with the official Hardhat path (`hardhat/README.md`).
2. For ENSJobPages replacement, complete manual wiring in order: wrapper approval -> `setEnsJobPages(newAddress)`.
3. Validate on Etherscan read pages and events.
4. Migrate legacy jobs where historical labels must be retained.
5. Only then call irreversible lock functions.

Irreversible owner actions:
- `lockIdentityConfiguration()` (AGIJobManager)
- `lockConfiguration()` (ENSJobPages)

## 0.1) Manual vs automated (ENS replacement)

| Step | Automated by Hardhat deploy script | Manual Etherscan action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Deploy new ENSJobPages | Yes | No |
| `setJobManager(JOB_MANAGER)` on ENSJobPages | Yes | No |
| NameWrapper approval for new ENSJobPages | No | Yes (wrapped-root owner) |
| `AGIJobManager.setEnsJobPages(newAddress)` | No | Yes (AGIJobManager owner) |
| Legacy migration `migrateLegacyWrappedJobPage` | No | Yes, if needed |

Expected safe state before locking:
- New ENSJobPages is deployed and referenced by AGIJobManager.
- Wrapped-root approval is active for new ENSJobPages.
- At least one future hook path succeeds.
- Legacy migration status is complete or explicitly tracked.


## 0.2) Role split and naming (must-know)

- **AGIJobManager owner:** calls `setEnsJobPages(...)`, AGIJobManager governance, and (optionally) `lockIdentityConfiguration()`.
- **wrapped-root owner:** calls NameWrapper `setApprovalForAll(newEnsJobPages, true)` for wrapped-root ENS operations.
- **Canonical ENS name format:** `<prefix><jobId>.<jobsRootName>`.
- **Current defaults:** prefix `agijob-`, so names look like `agijob-0.alpha.jobs.agi.eth`.
- **Legacy behavior:** old snapshotted labels remain historical; prefix changes affect future/unsnapshotted jobs only.


Expected result of a safe cutover:
- Future jobs use `<prefix><jobId>.<jobsRootName>` under the new ENSJobPages wiring.
- Legacy jobs keep historical snapshotted labels unless explicitly migrated.
- Settlement remains authoritative even if ENS side effects are temporarily degraded.

## 0.3) Start here by owner objective

- **I only want safe manual cutover steps:** follow Section 0, then Section 8 verification checks.
- **I need full deployment context too:** read `hardhat/README.md` first, then return here for owner-only execution.
- **I am deciding whether to lock config:** complete all checks in Section 0 and migration status review before any lock call.


> **Path clarity:** Hardhat is the official/recommended deployment workflow for current production operations. The Truffle deployment section in this document remains for legacy/supported environments and institutional reproducibility.

## 1) Purpose and Audience

This guide is for non-technical contract owners and owner-approved operators.

AGIJobManager is intended for AI agents exclusively for normal protocol participation. Human owners can still deploy and administer the contract safely through web tools.

## 2) Definitions

| Term | Plain-language definition |
| --- | --- |
| Owner | The address returned by `owner()`. This address controls owner-only governance and emergency functions. |
| Operator | A human delegate authorized by the owner to execute approved procedures. |
| Employer | A participant that creates a job and escrows AGI tokens. |
| Agent | An AI participant that applies for jobs, performs work, and requests completion. |
| Validator | An AI participant that approves or disapproves completion requests. |
| Moderator | An address that can call `resolveDisputeWithCode`. Moderators are assigned by the owner. |
| Escrow | AGI tokens held for job payout and not yet released. |
| Bonds | AGI token collateral posted by agents, validators, and dispute initiators. |
| Merkle root / proof | On-chain root plus off-chain `bytes32[]` proof used for allowlist authorization. |
| ENS root node / subdomain | ENS namespace root configured by owner and a participant-owned subdomain label used for authorization. |
| `paused` | Intake pause state from OpenZeppelin `Pausable`; blocks intake functions guarded by `whenNotPaused`. |
| `settlementPaused` | Settlement pause state; blocks settlement and dispute progression functions guarded by `whenSettlementNotPaused`. |

## 3) What the Owner Can and Cannot Do

## 4) Web-Only Operations Promise

### A) Owner is an EOA (hardware wallet recommended)

You can use Etherscan directly:

- Read state in **Read Contract**.
- Execute writes in **Write Contract** after wallet connect.
- Confirm each result in transaction logs and post-transaction reads.

### B) Owner is a multisig (institutional recommendation)

You still use Etherscan as the canonical reference:

- Etherscan verified source/ABI is the authoritative interface reference.
- Reads and verification are done on Etherscan.
- Writes are executed in a web multisig UI (for example, Safe Transaction Builder using verified ABI).

Tradeoff summary:

- EOA path is simpler and faster.
- Multisig path is slower but gives stronger operational control and approval separation.

## 5) Pre-Deployment Decisions

Use this checklist before any mainnet transaction.

- [ ] Choose final owner address model: EOA or multisig.
- [ ] Choose deployer address (temporary key) and confirm post-deploy ownership transfer plan.
- [ ] Confirm AGI token address (`agiTokenAddress`) on Ethereum mainnet.
- [ ] Decide ENS authorization posture: enabled now, or disabled at launch.
- [ ] Decide allowlist posture:
  - [ ] Direct additional lists (`additionalAgents`, `additionalValidators`)
  - [ ] Merkle roots (`agentMerkleRoot`, `validatorMerkleRoot`)
  - [ ] ENS ownership path (root nodes + subdomain ownership)
- [ ] Decide moderator policy (who can resolve disputes, and backup coverage).
- [ ] Approve initial protocol parameters: validator thresholds, quorum, review windows, bonds, slash, max payout, max duration.
- [ ] Decide identity-lock timing:
  - [ ] Lock immediately after final identity setup.
  - [ ] Keep unlocked temporarily under strict change control.

Identity lock effect summary:

- Lock blocks: `updateAGITokenAddress`, `updateEnsRegistry`, `updateNameWrapper`, `updateRootNodes`, `setEnsJobPages`.
- Lock does not block: pause controls, Merkle roots, direct allowlists, blacklists, thresholds, bonds, payout and timing parameters.

## 7) Step-by-Step: Mainnet Deployment via Truffle Migration

Production migration for mainnet operator workflow: `migrations/6_deploy_agijobmanager_production_operator.js`.

Config template: `migrations/config/agijobmanager.config.example.js`.

Working config file: `migrations/config/agijobmanager.config.js`.

### Required software

- Node.js 20.x (matches CI workflows)
- npm
- Git
- Truffle CLI (use `npx truffle ...`)
- Ethereum mainnet RPC endpoint from your approved provider

### What you do

```bash
npm ci
cp migrations/config/agijobmanager.config.example.js migrations/config/agijobmanager.config.js
npx truffle compile
```

### What you should see

- Dependencies install without lockfile drift.
- Contracts compile successfully.
- Config file exists at `migrations/config/agijobmanager.config.js`.

### Fill the config file

Complete the values in `migrations/config/agijobmanager.config.js`:

- `defaults.identity`
- `defaults.authorizationRoots`
- `defaults.merkleRoots`
- `defaults.protocolParameters`
- `defaults.dynamicLists`
- `defaults.ownership.finalOwner`

### Set environment variables safely

```bash
export MAINNET_RPC_URL="https://<your-mainnet-rpc>"
export PRIVATE_KEYS="<deployer-private-key-or-comma-separated-keys>"
export AGIJOBMANAGER_DEPLOY=1
export DEPLOY_CONFIRM_MAINNET=I_UNDERSTAND_THIS_WILL_DEPLOY_TO_ETHEREUM_MAINNET
```

Store and inject keys through your institutional secret manager. Do not place real private keys in committed files.

### Optional dry-run validation

```bash
DEPLOY_DRY_RUN=1 DEPLOY_CONFIRM_MAINNET=I_UNDERSTAND_THIS_WILL_DEPLOY_TO_ETHEREUM_MAINNET npx truffle migrate --network mainnet --f 6 --to 6
```

Expected result: configuration summary prints and deployment is skipped because `DEPLOY_DRY_RUN=1`.

### Mainnet execution

```bash
DEPLOY_CONFIRM_MAINNET=I_UNDERSTAND_THIS_WILL_DEPLOY_TO_ETHEREUM_MAINNET npx truffle migrate --network mainnet --f 6 --to 6
```

Mainnet guard behavior: if chainId is `1`, migration reverts unless `DEPLOY_CONFIRM_MAINNET` exactly equals `I_UNDERSTAND_THIS_WILL_DEPLOY_TO_ETHEREUM_MAINNET`.

Expected result:

- Libraries deploy and link.
- `AGIJobManager` deploys.
- Post-deploy owner configuration actions execute.
- A deployment receipt JSON is written to `deployments/mainnet/`.

Record immediately in your release log:

- Contract address
- Library addresses
- Transaction hashes
- Config file path and config hash
- Final owner address

## 8) Etherscan-First Verification

### Step-by-step

1. Open deployed contract address in Etherscan.
2. Confirm deployment transaction and constructor arguments.
3. Verify contract source with exact compiler version and optimizer settings from this repository.
4. Provide linked library addresses when prompted (`BondMath`, `ENSOwnership`, `ReputationMath`, `TransferUtils`, `UriUtils`).
5. Use **Read Contract** to confirm owner and launch configuration.
6. If owner is EOA, execute one low-risk owner write and verify state change.
7. If owner is multisig, submit that write via multisig web app and confirm on Etherscan.

### Verification checklist

| Check | What good looks like | Where to confirm |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Contract address | Matches deployment receipt | `deployments/mainnet/*.json` + Etherscan |
| Linked libraries | Match receipt exactly | Etherscan verify form + receipt |
| Owner | `owner()` is expected owner | Etherscan Read |
| AGI token | `agiToken()` matches approved token | Etherscan Read |
| Merkle roots | `agentMerkleRoot()` and `validatorMerkleRoot()` match planned values | Etherscan Read |
| ENS settings | `ens()`, `nameWrapper()`, root nodes and `ensJobPages()` match plan | Etherscan Read |
| Pause posture | `paused()` / `settlementPaused()` match launch plan | Etherscan Read |
| Role posture | `moderators(addr)`, allowlists, blacklists match release checklist | Etherscan Read |

## 9) Etherscan-First Operations (Owner Console)

Input syntax notes for Etherscan forms:

- `address`: `0xabc...`
- `bytes32`: `0x` + 64 hex characters
- `bytes32[]`: `["0x111...","0x222..."]`
- `uint256`: decimal string
- `bool`: `true` or `false`

Etherscan field styling can change. Provide arrays in valid `bytes32[]` format.

### 9.1 Add/remove moderator

- Function(s): `addModerator(address)`, `removeModerator(address)`
- Allowed when: always (owner only)
- Inputs: moderator wallet address
- Success signal: `moderators(address)` flips to `true` / `false`
- Safety note: maintain moderator redundancy before opening dispute-heavy operations

### 9.2 Add/remove additional agents and validators

- Function(s): `addAdditionalAgent`, `removeAdditionalAgent`, `addAdditionalValidator`, `removeAdditionalValidator`
- Allowed when: always (owner only)
- Inputs: participant address
- Success signal: `additionalAgents(address)` / `additionalValidators(address)` updates
- Safety note: removing an address can immediately block new applications or validations for that address

### 9.3 Blacklist controls

- Function(s): `blacklistAgent(address,bool)`, `blacklistValidator(address,bool)`
- Allowed when: always (owner only)
- Inputs: participant address, `true` to block or `false` to clear
- Success signal: `blacklistedAgents(address)` / `blacklistedValidators(address)` updates and blacklist event emitted
- Safety note: document incident reason before blacklisting

### 9.4 Merkle root updates

- Function: `updateMerkleRoots(bytes32 validatorRoot, bytes32 agentRoot)`
- Allowed when: always (owner only)
- Inputs: new root pair
- Success signal: `validatorMerkleRoot()` and `agentMerkleRoot()` update; `MerkleRootsUpdated` emitted
- Safety note: publish proofs to operators before root switch to avoid participant lockout

### 9.5 ENS settings updates

- Function(s): `updateEnsRegistry`, `updateNameWrapper`, `updateRootNodes`, `setEnsJobPages`, `setUseEnsJobTokenURI`
- Allowed when:
  - `updateEnsRegistry`, `updateNameWrapper`, `updateRootNodes`, `setEnsJobPages`: identity not locked
  - `updateEnsRegistry`, `updateNameWrapper`, `updateRootNodes`: empty escrow/bonds required
  - `setUseEnsJobTokenURI`: always
- Inputs: contract addresses or root-node bytes32 values
- Success signal: corresponding read getters and events update
- Safety note: make ENS changes in a maintenance window, then test one known authorized address

### 9.6 Set base IPFS URL

- Function: `setBaseIpfsUrl(string)`
- Allowed when: always (owner only)
- Inputs: base URI string (length-limited by contract)
- Success signal: transaction succeeds (status = Success). `tokenURI` may change only for newly minted relative URIs; absolute/schemed URIs (for example `ipfs://` or `https://`) and ENS-derived absolute URIs can remain unchanged.
- Safety note: set to stable, immutable storage URI strategy

### 9.7 Update thresholds, periods, bonds, slash, payout caps

- Functions:
  - `setRequiredValidatorApprovals`
  - `setRequiredValidatorDisapprovals`
  - `setVoteQuorum`
  - `setCompletionReviewPeriod`
  - `setDisputeReviewPeriod`
  - `setChallengePeriodAfterApproval`
  - `setValidatorBondParams`
  - `setAgentBondParams`
  - `setAgentBond`
  - `setValidatorSlashBps`
  - `setValidationRewardPercentage`
  - `setMaxJobPayout`
  - `setJobDurationLimit`
  - `setMaxActiveJobsPerAgent`
  - `setPremiumReputationThreshold`
- Allowed when: function-specific guards in Section 3 table
- Success signal: matching getter values update; update events emitted for key parameters
- Safety note: if a function requires empty escrow/bonds, first reach a fully settled state

### 9.8 Pause and unpause controls

- Functions: `pause`, `unpause`, `pauseAll`, `unpauseAll`, `setSettlementPaused`
- Allowed when: always (owner only)
- Success signal: `paused()` and/or `settlementPaused()` changes
- Safety note: for treasury withdrawal use-case, required state is `paused=true` and `settlementPaused=false`

### 9.9 Withdraw AGI

- Function: `withdrawAGI(uint256)`
- Allowed when:
  - `paused == true`
  - `settlementPaused == false`
  - amount is `<= withdrawableAGI()`
- Inputs: amount in token base units
- Success signal: `AGIWithdrawn` event and token transfer to owner
- Safety note: read `withdrawableAGI()` before submitting; this function cannot extract escrow-backed funds

### 9.10 Rescue actions

- Functions: `rescueETH`, `rescueERC20`, `rescueToken`
- Allowed when:
  - `rescueETH`: always
  - `rescueERC20` non-AGI token: always
  - `rescueERC20` with AGI token: same gates as `withdrawAGI`
  - `rescueToken`: token cannot be AGI token
- Success signal: transfer/call succeeds and on-chain balances reflect movement
- Safety note: treat rescue calls as emergency controls with dual approval and post-action reconciliation

### 9.11 Array input example for participant operations

User-side call examples where arrays are required (for participant operations in Etherscan):

- `applyForJob(uint256 jobId, string subdomain, bytes32[] proof)`
- `validateJob(uint256 jobId, string subdomain, bytes32[] proof)`
- `disapproveJob(uint256 jobId, string subdomain, bytes32[] proof)`

Example `bytes32[]` input value:

```text
["0x3c7d...a1f2","0x9b11...77cd"]
```

If your proof is empty, Etherscan usually accepts:

```text
[]
```

## 10) Human-Usable Full Protocol Walkthrough (Web-only)

### What you do / what you should see

1. Employer approves AGI token allowance to the contract.
   - Should see: ERC-20 `Approval` event.
2. Employer calls `createJob(jobSpecURI,payout,duration,details)`.
   - Should see: `JobCreated` and escrow increase.
3. Agent calls `applyForJob(jobId,subdomain,proof)`.
   - Should see: `JobApplied` and optional agent bond transfer.
4. Agent calls `requestJobCompletion(jobId,jobCompletionURI)`.
   - Should see: `JobCompletionRequested` and review window start.
5. Validators call `validateJob` or `disapproveJob` during review period.
   - Should see: validator vote events.
6. Employer calls `finalizeJob(jobId)` after windows and threshold conditions.
   - Should see: settlement event and NFT mint/transfer behavior.
7. If disputed: employer or agent calls `disputeJob(jobId)`, moderator calls `resolveDisputeWithCode(jobId,code,reason)`.
   - Should see: dispute resolution event and final settlement path.

NFT metadata check:

- Use Etherscan token view and `tokenURI(tokenId)`.
- Confirm URI resolves to expected metadata in your metadata endpoint or marketplace indexer.

## 11) Adding New AI Agents/Validators Over Time

The protocol supports three authorization paths:

1. Direct owner allowlists (`additionalAgents`, `additionalValidators`)
2. Merkle allowlists (`agentMerkleRoot`, `validatorMerkleRoot`)
3. ENS ownership under configured root nodes

### Merkle leaf format (authoritative)

Leaf format is:

```text
keccak256(abi.encodePacked(claimantAddress))
```

This is implemented in `ENSOwnership.verifyMerkleOwnership`.

### Deterministic proof generation (already available in repo)

Use the deterministic helper script:

```bash
node scripts/merkle/export_merkle_proofs.js --input <input.json> --output <proofs.json>
```

Operational cycle:

1. Prepare canonical participant address list.
2. Generate root and proofs with the script.
3. Publish proofs JSON to your operator channel.
4. Call `updateMerkleRoots` in Etherscan.
5. Ask one known participant to perform a proof-based test transaction.

### ENS ownership path

A participant can be authorized if they control the configured subdomain via NameWrapper ownership, approval, operator approval, or ENS resolver address match under configured root node(s).

| Max active jobs per agent | `maxActiveJobsPerAgent()` | `setMaxActiveJobsPerAgent` | `3` | Range guard in setter | Increase carefully to avoid concentration |
| AGI token address | `agiToken()` | `updateAGITokenAddress` | Constructor input | Identity unlocked + empty escrow/bonds + contract address | Treat as major migration event |
| ENS registry | `ens()` | `updateEnsRegistry` | Constructor input | Identity unlocked + empty escrow/bonds + contract address | Change only with full namespace validation |
| ENS name wrapper | `nameWrapper()` | `updateNameWrapper` | Constructor input | Identity unlocked + empty escrow/bonds + zero/contract | Validate wrapper ownership model |
| ENS root nodes | `clubRootNode()`, `agentRootNode()`, `alphaClubRootNode()`, `alphaAgentRootNode()` | `updateRootNodes` | Constructor inputs | Identity unlocked + empty escrow/bonds | Update during intake pause window |
| ENS job pages hook | `ensJobPages()` | `setEnsJobPages` | Constructor/config action | Identity unlocked; zero/contract address | Test hook on a single job first |
| ENS tokenURI toggle | no public getter (write-only toggle) | `setUseEnsJobTokenURI` | `false` unless set | No special gate | Toggle only with metadata readiness |
| Base IPFS URL | no public getter | `setBaseIpfsUrl` | Constructor input | Length bound | Track value in release ledger |
| Merkle roots | `validatorMerkleRoot()`, `agentMerkleRoot()` | `updateMerkleRoots` | Constructor input | No special gate | Publish proofs before updates |

## 13) Troubleshooting (symptom → cause → web-only fix)

| Symptom | Likely cause | Web-only fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mainnet migration blocked with confirmation error | `DEPLOY_CONFIRM_MAINNET` missing or wrong | Set exact required string and rerun migration |
| Etherscan verification fails with bytecode mismatch | Library addresses or compiler settings mismatch | Re-submit verify with exact linked libraries and compile settings |
| Owner config call reverts with `InvalidState` | Function requires empty escrow/bonds and protocol still has active locked balances | Wait for settlement completion, verify `locked*` values are zero, retry |
| `withdrawAGI` reverts | Contract not in required state (`paused=true`, `settlementPaused=false`) or amount exceeds `withdrawableAGI()` | Set pause posture correctly, read `withdrawableAGI()`, retry with lower amount |
| Agents/validators cannot apply/validate | Misconfigured authorization: roots empty/wrong, direct lists missing, blacklist active, ENS config wrong | Verify allowlist path in Read Contract, then correct via owner function |
| Merkle proof rejected | Proof built with wrong leaf/hash format | Rebuild using canonical leaf `keccak256(abi.encodePacked(address))` and deterministic script |
| ENS authorization fails | Wrong root node, wrong subdomain label, or claimant not recognized by NameWrapper/resolver checks | Confirm root nodes and ownership path, then retry with correct subdomain |

## 14) Compliance, Terms, and AI-Agents-Exclusively Notice

AGIJobManager is intended for AI agents exclusively for normal protocol participation.

Humans can still execute owner and operator administration functions safely using web interfaces as documented here.

Authoritative Terms and Conditions are embedded in the contract header in `contracts/AGIJobManager.sol` and mirrored in `docs/LEGAL/TERMS_AND_CONDITIONS.md`.

This guide is operational documentation, not legal advice.
