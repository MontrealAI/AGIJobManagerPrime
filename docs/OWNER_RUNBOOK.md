# OWNER RUNBOOK (Low-touch operations)

This runbook is optimized for autonomous, checklist-driven operations and Etherscan-first control.

## In one minute (owner/operator)
- Use Hardhat for deploy/replacement; use Etherscan for owner controls and verification reads.
- ENSJobPages cutover is additive: deploy new ENSJobPages, grant wrapper approval, set AGIJobManager ENSJobPages pointer, migrate legacy jobs if needed, lock only after validation.
- Never lock identity/configuration before validating addresses, approvals, and expected ENS hook behavior.


## Start here by owner intent
- **I need to deploy or replace ENSJobPages now:** use `hardhat/README.md`, then `docs/DEPLOYMENT/ENS_JOB_PAGES_MAINNET_REPLACEMENT.md`.
- **I only need manual owner actions on Etherscan:** use `docs/ETHERSCAN_GUIDE.md` and this runbook.
- **I am about to lock config:** complete the lock preflight checklist below first.


## ENS replacement responsibilities (owner split)
- **wrapped-root owner**: `NameWrapper.setApprovalForAll(newEnsJobPages, true)`.
- **AGIJobManager owner**: `setEnsJobPages(newEnsJobPages)` on AGIJobManager.
- **ENSJobPages owner (if needed)**: `migrateLegacyWrappedJobPage(jobId, exactLabel)` for legacy jobs missing snapshots.

Expected result:
- Future jobs resolve using `<prefix><jobId>.<jobsRootName>` (default prefix `agijob`).
- Legacy snapshotted labels remain stable unless explicitly migrated/imported.


## Manual vs automated (owner-safe expectations)

- **Scripted:** deployment/verification workflows (Hardhat recommended).
- **Manual on Etherscan:** NameWrapper approval, `setEnsJobPages`, optional legacy migration, lock calls.
- **Never assume automated:** cutover wiring and migration decisions.

Expected result before lock calls:
- `ensJobPages()` points at intended address.
- NameWrapper approval for that address is active.
- Future job hooks are behaving as expected.
- Legacy migration status is complete or explicitly tracked.

## 1) Deployment checklist

1. Compile with repository defaults (Truffle + optimizer settings from `truffle-config.js`).
2. Link external libraries exactly as deployment scripts/Truffle artifacts require.
3. Deploy constructor args carefully:
   - AGI token address,
   - base IPFS URL,
   - ENS config addresses,
   - root nodes,
   - initial Merkle roots.
4. Verify AGIJobManager and linked libraries on Etherscan (see [`VERIFY_ON_ETHERSCAN.md`](VERIFY_ON_ETHERSCAN.md)).
5. Verify ENSJobPages and ensure selector compatibility tests pass:
   - `handleHook(uint8,uint256)` -> `0x1f76f7a2` / calldata `0x44`
   - `jobEnsURI(uint256)` -> `0x751809b4` / calldata `0x24`
6. Run post-deploy sanity reads: `paused`, `settlementPaused`, Merkle roots, root nodes, token address.

Use deterministic offline helpers before any write:
```bash
node scripts/etherscan/prepare_inputs.js --action approve --spender 0xAGIJobManagerAddress --amount 1200
node scripts/advisor/state_advisor.js --input scripts/advisor/sample_job_state.json
```

## 2) Safe defaults + staged rollout

- Phase 0: `pauseAll` enabled; configure params/roles.
- Phase 1: keep settlement paused (`unpause` + `setSettlementPaused(true)`) for a controlled read-only warm-up; note this also blocks `createJob`/`applyForJob` writes because they require `whenSettlementNotPaused`.
- Phase 2: enable live operations (`setSettlementPaused(false)`) once moderators/validators are ready; this opens both intake and settlement paths.
- Use conservative thresholds/quorum first; ratchet only after observing production behavior.

## 3) Incident playbooks

## A) Stop intake only (allow settlements to finish)
1. `pause()` (or `pauseIntake()`).
2. Keep `setSettlementPaused(false)`.
3. Communicate: no new jobs, active jobs continue.

## B) Stop settlement lane (also blocks create/apply writes)
1. `setSettlementPaused(true)`.
2. Expect settlement actions **and** `createJob`/`applyForJob` writes to be paused by `whenSettlementNotPaused`.
3. Keep `paused()` state unchanged so read/observability remains available.
4. Communicate expected resume timing and that new intake writes are temporarily unavailable.

## C) Full stop
1. `pauseAll()`.
2. Verify both lanes paused (`paused==true`, `settlementPaused==true`).
3. Publish incident bulletin + next decision checkpoint.

## 4) Revenue withdrawals without escrow risk

Before `withdrawAGI(amount)`:
1. Read `withdrawableAGI()`.
2. Ensure `amount <= withdrawableAGI()`.
3. Confirm protocol is paused for withdrawals (`withdrawAGI` requires `whenPaused` and settlement not paused).
4. Execute withdrawal in small chunks when uncertain.
5. Save transaction hash in operations log and re-check `withdrawableAGI()` after each chunk.

Never bypass solvency checks via rescue functions for AGI escrow assets.

## 5) Allowlist governance (Merkle roots)

Rotation procedure:
1. Build root + proofs offline from canonical address list.
2. Peer-review generated root/proofs.
3. Announce effective block/time and grace period.
4. Call `updateMerkleRoots(validatorRoot, agentRoot)`.
5. Publish proof file and rollback plan.

Use deterministic scripts:
```bash
node scripts/merkle/export_merkle_proofs.js --input allowlist.json --output proofs.json
```

## 6) ENS operations

Role split reminder:
- **wrapped-root owner** executes NameWrapper approvals.
- **AGIJobManager owner** executes `setEnsJobPages` and AGIJobManager identity controls.


- Configure ENS via `updateEnsRegistry`, `updateNameWrapper`, `updateRootNodes`.
- Point job pages with `setEnsJobPages`.
- Enable/disable ENS-backed token URI path via `setUseEnsJobTokenURI`.
- Lock identity config permanently with `lockIdentityConfiguration` only after full validation.

`lockIdentityConfiguration` is irreversible. Delay until final addresses/nodes are battle-tested.

## 6.1) Lock preflight (do not skip)

Before `lockIdentityConfiguration()` or `lockConfiguration()`:
- [ ] AGIJobManager points to the intended ENSJobPages.
- [ ] NameWrapper approval is active for wrapped-root operations.
- [ ] At least one future job hook path succeeds.
- [ ] Legacy jobs that require historical labels are migrated or explicitly tracked.
- [ ] You understand lock calls are irreversible.

## 7) High-risk actions (operator warnings)

- `rescueERC20`, `rescueToken`: emergency-only, must not violate escrow solvency assumptions.
- `updateAGITokenAddress`: identity-critical; only before lock.
- `updateEnsRegistry`/`updateNameWrapper`/`updateRootNodes`/`setEnsJobPages`: identity-critical; only before lock.
- Parameter setters affecting incentives (`setValidatorBondParams`, `setAgentBondParams`, `setValidatorSlashBps`, `setVoteQuorum`, etc.) should use change tickets and announced effective times.
