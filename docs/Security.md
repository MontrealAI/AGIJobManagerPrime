# Security model and limitations

This document summarizes security considerations specific to the current `AGIJobManager` contract. It should be read alongside the test suite and interface reference.

## Threat model overview

**Assets at risk**
- Escrowed ERC‑20 funds held by the contract.
- Job NFTs minted on completion.
- Reputation mappings used for premium access gating.

**Audit status**
- No public audit report is included in this repository. Treat deployments as experimental until independently reviewed.

**Primary trust assumptions (centralization risks)**
- **Owner powers**: can pause flows, update token address and parameters, manage allowlists/blacklists, add AGI types, and withdraw ERC‑20 while paused (limited to `withdrawableAGI()`).
- **Policy control**: owner can update Merkle roots, validation thresholds, and payout percentages, which can materially change who can validate jobs and how funds are split.
- **Moderator powers**: resolve disputes with typed action codes via `resolveDisputeWithCode`. Code `0` (NO_ACTION) logs a reason and keeps the dispute active; `1` (AGENT_WIN) pays the agent; `2` (EMPLOYER_WIN) refunds the employer. The legacy string-based `resolveDispute` is deprecated and maps exact `agent win` / `employer win` strings to the corresponding codes.
- **Validator set**: validators are allowlisted or ENS/Merkle‑gated; the contract does not enforce decentralization or slashing.

## Hardened improvements (vs. historical v0)
The regression suite documents the following safer behaviors in the current contract:
- **Phantom job IDs blocked**: `_job` rejects non‑existent jobs.
- **Pre‑apply takeover blocked**: agents cannot claim assignments before a job exists.
- **Double completion blocked**: employer‑win dispute resolution closes the job.
- **Division‑by‑zero avoided**: agent‑win disputes complete safely when no validators voted.
- **Validator double‑votes blocked**: validators cannot both approve and disapprove the same job.
- **Transfer checks enforced**: ERC‑20 transfers must return true or the call reverts.
- **Failed refunds revert**: `cancelJob` and refunds do not silently drop escrow.

See [`REGRESSION_TESTS.md`](REGRESSION_TESTS.md) for details.

## Reentrancy posture
`ReentrancyGuard` is applied to:
- `createJob`, `applyForJob`, `validateJob`, `disapproveJob`, `disputeJob`, `resolveDispute`, `resolveDisputeWithCode`, `resolveStaleDispute`, `cancelJob`, `expireJob`, `finalizeJob`, `withdrawAGI`, `contributeToRewardPool`.

Functions without `nonReentrant` include `requestJobCompletion`. External ERC‑20 transfer paths (`createJob`, `withdrawAGI`, `contributeToRewardPool`, dispute resolution, settlement) are guarded where they cross token boundaries.

## Known limitations and assumptions
- **Root immutability**: ENS root nodes are fixed at deployment and cannot be changed on-chain. Merkle roots **can** be updated by the owner via `updateMerkleRoots`; misconfigured roots can be corrected without redeploying, but updates should follow a strict governance process.
- **ENS dependency**: ownership checks rely on ENS registry, NameWrapper, and resolver behavior.
- **ERC‑20 compatibility**: transfers must either return `true` or return no data; calls that revert, return `false`, or return malformed data revert.
- **Agent payout snapshot enforced**: agents must have a nonzero AGI‑type payout tier at apply time; the payout percentage is snapshotted on assignment and used at completion, preventing later NFT transfers from changing settlement for an accepted job. This resolves the earlier 0%/allowlist default payout gap.
- **Validator payout sharing**: all validators who voted share equally; there is no weighting or slashing.
- **Validator cap**: each job records at most `MAX_VALIDATORS_PER_JOB` unique validators to bound settlement gas. Owner‑set thresholds must fit within this cap (each ≤ cap and approvals + disapprovals ≤ cap) to keep completion/dispute reachable without exceeding the loop bound.
- **Owner‑controlled parameters**: thresholds and limits can be changed post‑deployment by the owner.
- **Time enforcement gap**: only `requestJobCompletion` enforces job duration; validators can still approve/disapprove after the deadline unless off‑chain policy prevents it.

## Operational monitoring
- Index and alert on `JobDisputed`, `DisputeResolvedWithCode`, `DisputeResolved`, `JobCompleted`, and `ReputationUpdated` events.
- Track `OwnershipVerified` to monitor ENS/Merkle ownership checks.
